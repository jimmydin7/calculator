## 10/2/2025 10 AM - Completed half of the schematic  

I spent 4 hours yesterday working on the schematic. At first I was gonna use a xiao rp 2040, so I would have to do a matrix layout, but I then decided to go for the raspberry pi pico which has many gpios. I connected all keys and an LCD screen. I used a technique called **i2c** which a friend told me about. This way, I only had to connect 2 gpios. (4 hours may seem a lot, but it is my second PCB and I remade it 2-3 times because I tried to actually understand everything. I also have to switch to labels soon)

## 10/2/2025 8 PM - Designed a demo PCB  

Did some brainstorimg on the PCB. I imported everything from the schematic - I had to spend some time searching for footprints. After that I was gonna use the Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE) but I just hand-placed the keys for now since I plan this to be bare. I love slowly seeing it come to life! I also spent some time on sketch.io designing the overall look. I will probably have to change everything, switches aren't alined, routing isn't done, and outline is wrong.

## 10/3/2025 - Did brainstorming while in stupid class  

Today I had ancient-greek class, which I don't care about since imma follow a path with math & cs, so I spent the majority of the time drawing out the design of my calculator. I changed the placement of the button multiple times but the end result is this and I think its pretty cool! it fits everything and takes up the correct space. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--edd646efbefe3d2e537fcd84bd2209c8ac320bf7/image.png)
  

## 10/5/2025 4 PM - Setup Edge.cuts layer  

Today I setup the Edge.cuts layer. I drew a rectangle and used the measure tool, and made sure the usb from the raspberry pi pico is outside of the pcb. I also changed the position of the screen, keys, and rotary encoder to make sure everything is as it should!

## 10/5/2025 6 PM - final GPIOs + 3d view!  

I spent around 2.5 hours setting up the power gpios + 3d view! People in a slack thread helped me set up the gpios, 3v3, GND configurations for the open gpios on the pico, and I close the unused ones! I also did the same on the LCD. I spent some more time researching the manufacturer's website for the lcd, and I also digged the internet to find .step files for every component!
