## 10/2/2025 10 AM - Completed half of the schematic  

I spent 4 hours yesterday working on the schematic. At first I was gonna use a xiao rp 2040, so I would have to do a matrix layout, but I then decided to go for the raspberry pi pico which has many gpios. I connected all keys and an LCD screen. I used a technique called **i2c** which a friend told me about. This way, I only had to connect 2 gpios. (4 hours may seem a lot, but it is my second PCB and I remade it 2-3 times because I tried to actually understand everything. I also have to switch to labels soon)

## 10/2/2025 8 PM - Designed a demo PCB  

Did some brainstorimg on the PCB. I imported everything from the schematic - I had to spend some time searching for footprints. After that I was gonna use the Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE) but I just hand-placed the keys for now since I plan this to be bare. I love slowly seeing it come to life! I also spent some time on sketch.io designing the overall look. I will probably have to change everything, switches aren't alined, routing isn't done, and outline is wrong.
